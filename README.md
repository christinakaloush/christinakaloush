# Hi, Iâ€™m Tina ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic software developer with a talent for building strong, collaborative relationships. I have experience across various technologies including TypeScript, HTML/CSS, React, and C#.NET. I'm eager to continue growing in the development field and leverage technology for good.

Though I had a range of interests growing up, I gravitated toward a degree in math based on my love of problem solving. After earning a BS at Grand Valley State University, I found myself moving away from traditional office work toward people centered roles that played to my creative strengths. While working for a variety of nonprofits, I often noticed inefficiencies and took the initiative to solve them using tools like Excel. Through these experiences, I stumbled across computer science, a subject that combined problem solving, lifelong learning, creativity, and connection. That blend of analytical thinking and people centered creativity continues to guide my approach as a developer today.

Outside of tech I enjoy learning in all forms, whether it's curling up with a good book, solving crosswords, staying informed about the state of our world, or finding creative ways to win at Scrabble. I like to stay active running, hiking, playing soccer, and cycling. When it's time to relax, there's no better place to be than in the woods camping with friends and family. I credit my hard-working attitude to the many role models in my life, especially my mother and grandmothers who immigrated from Lebanon. They taught me the importance of striving to be the best version of myself.

Letâ€™s build something great together :)
